Going with\r\nthis implementation had several advantages. First, posts are formatted and\r\nstored in "},{type:b,tag:c,props:{href:"https:\u002F\u002Fdaringfireball.net\u002Fprojects\u002Fmarkdown",rel:[d,e,f],target:g},children:[{type:a,value:q}]},{type:a,value:". This allows\r\npost content to be decoupled from the layout of the website. Second, there is no\r\ndatabase to manage and in turn, no database security concerns to contend with.\r\nThird, since Nuxt.js is built on top of "},{type:b,tag:c,props:{href:"https:\u002F\u002Fvuejs.org",rel:[d,e,f],target:g},children:[{type:a,value:n}]},{type:a,value:", it is easy\r\nto reuse code by defining custom reusable components using HTML, JavaScript, and\r\nCSS. Fourth, using Nuxt.js and Vue.js does not require me to learn a new\r\nprogramming language (e.g., Ruby, Go, etc.). Finally, the website is static, so\r\nit can be hosted free of charge on "},{type:b,tag:c,props:{href:"https:\u002F\u002Fpages.github.com",rel:[d,e,f],target:g},children:[{type:a,value:"GitHub Pages"}]},{type:a,value:"."}]},{type:a,value:h},{type:b,tag:k,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"As for the layout, I went with a plain and simple responsive UI built using the\r\n"},{type:b,tag:c,props:{href:"https:\u002F\u002Fbuefy.org",rel:[d,e,f],target:g},children:[{type:a,value:o}]},{type:a,value:" and "},{type:b,tag:c,props:{href:"https:\u002F\u002Fbulma.io",rel:[d,e,f],target:g},children:[{type:a,value:p}]},{type:a,value:" CSS frameworks.
